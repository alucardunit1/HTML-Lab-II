        Rally racing is an exhilarating form of motorsport that takes place on
        closed public or private roads, often in challenging terrains like dirt,
        gravel, snow, or tarmac. Here's a beginner's guide to understanding the
        basics of rally racing:

        <h3 class="Ctext">What is Rally Racing</h3>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rally racing involves drivers and co-drivers competing in timed
            stages on varied surfaces and terrains.
          </li>
          <li>
            Unlike circuit racing (e.g., Formula 1 or NASCAR) rally courses are
            point-to-point, and competitors race against the clock rather than
            head-to-head.
          </li>
          <li>
            Rallies can last a single day or span multiple days, covering
            hundreds of miles.

      <section class="card">
        <h4>The Car</h4>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Rally cars are highly modified production vehicles designed for
            durability and performance on rough terrain.
          </li>
          <li>
            They feature all-wheel drive (AWD), reinforced suspension, roll
            cages, and specialized tires for different conditions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Popular rally cars include the Subaru Impreza WRX, Ford Fiesta RS,
            and Toyota GR Yaris.
          </li>
        </ul>
      </section>
    </div>

    <div>
      <h4>The Crew</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Driver:</strong> Controls the car and navigates the course.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Co-Driver:</strong> Sits in the passenger seat and reads pace
          notes (detailed instructions about the course) to guide the driver.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Crew:</strong> In rally racing, there is no
          traditional pit crew like in circuit racing (e.g., Formula 1 or
          NASCAR), but there is a service crew that plays a similar role.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>The Stages/Tracks</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Normal Stage</strong> Rallies are divided into stages (timed
          sections) and transit stages (non-timed sections where drivers move
          between the stages)
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Special Stage </strong>A special stage (SS) is a section of
          closed road at a stage rallying event used for timed speed tests. This
          is normally a public showcase race where most of the track can be seen
          from one spot
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
    <div>
      <h4>The Rules</h4>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Timing:</strong> The team with the lowest cumulative time
          across all stages wins.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Pace Notes:</strong> Co-drivers use pace notes to describe the
          road ahead (e.g., corners, jumps, hazards). These are often written
          during reconnaissance ("recce") runs.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Service Intervals:</strong> Teams have limited time to repair
          and maintain their cars between stages.
        </li>
      </ul>
