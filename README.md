W2 HTML Lab 2

Please create a site with 3 pages (homepage & gallery & about).
The site should include a navigation <nav> with <a> tags
at the top of all pages that allows the user to click between the 3
pages with <a> tags. (You don't need to style the <nav>.)
For the homepage, include the following tags: <nav>,

<main>, and <footer>. Start with an <h1> with the 
title of your site. Include a prominent picture near the top. Within the
 <main> section, include include a brief bio for yourself OR a 
brief paragraph about your hobby. In the footer, add "created at 
Codex".  At the top, include a <nav> with <a> tags that link
 to your other pages.
Next, create the gallery.html page.  It should also include  
<main>, and <footer> elements. At the top have your 
<nav> tag with links to the other pages. Then, in the <main>
 section, add at least three images. The footer can be the same as the 
one on the home page. This page should include the same type of 
navigation links as the homepage, so at the top, include a <nav> 
with <a> tags that link to your other pages.
Finally, create the about.html page. This page should include two 
lists. One will be an ordered list <ol> with a top 5 list related 
to your hobby OR other things important to you. The other list will be 
an unordered list <ul>. This list can be about anything you can 
think of and should contain 5 items. This page should include the same 
type of navigation links as the homepage, so at the top, include a 
<nav> with <a> tags that link to your other pages.
